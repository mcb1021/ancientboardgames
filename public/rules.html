    <h2 id="ur">Royal Game of Ur</h2>
    <p class="era">Mesopotamia • 2600 BCE</p>
    
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Be the first player to move all 7 of your pieces off the board.</p>
    
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>Each player has 7 pieces that start off the board. The board has 20 squares with 5 special "rosette" squares marked with flower patterns.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Roll the dice:</strong> Four tetrahedral (pyramid-shaped) dice are rolled. Count the marked corners facing up (0-4).</li>
        <li><strong>Move a piece:</strong> Move one of your pieces forward by the number rolled.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll of 0:</strong> If you roll 0, you lose your turn.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Special Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rosettes (flower squares):</strong> Landing on a rosette gives you an extra turn AND protects your piece from capture.</li>
        <li><strong>Capture:</strong> Landing on an opponent's piece sends it back to the start. You cannot capture pieces on rosettes.</li>
        <li><strong>Blocking:</strong> You cannot land on your own pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Exact exit:</strong> You must roll the exact number needed to bear a piece off the board.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="senet">Senet</h2>
    <p class="era">Egypt • 3100 BCE</p>
    
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Be the first to move all 5 of your pieces off the board, passing through the underworld to reach the afterlife.</p>
    
    <h3>The Board</h3>
    <p>30 squares arranged in 3 rows of 10. Pieces move in an S-pattern (boustrophedon): right across the top row, left across the middle, right across the bottom.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Throw the sticks:</strong> Four casting sticks determine movement (1-5). Rolling 1, 4, or 5 grants an extra turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Move a piece:</strong> Move one piece forward by the number thrown.</li>
        <li><strong>Swap:</strong> If you land on an opponent's piece, you swap positions (unless protected).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Special Squares</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>House of Rebirth (15):</strong> Safe square. Pieces sent back come here.</li>
        <li><strong>House of Beauty (26):</strong> Safe square. All pieces must stop here.</li>
        <li><strong>House of Water (27):</strong> Danger! Landing here sends your piece back to House of Rebirth.</li>
        <li><strong>House of Three Truths (28):</strong> Must roll exactly 3 to leave.</li>
        <li><strong>House of Re-Atoum (29):</strong> Must roll exactly 2 to leave.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="hnefatafl">Hnefatafl</h2>
    <p class="era">Scandinavia • 400 CE</p>
    
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Defenders (white):</strong> Help the King escape to any corner square.</li>
        <li><strong>Attackers (black):</strong> Capture the King by surrounding him on all 4 sides.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>The King starts in the center (throne) surrounded by 12 defenders. 24 attackers are positioned around the edges.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> All pieces move like a rook in chess — any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
        <li><strong>No jumping:</strong> Pieces cannot jump over other pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Restricted squares:</strong> Only the King may land on the throne (center) or corner squares.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Capture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Regular pieces:</strong> Captured by "custodian capture" — sandwiching between two enemy pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>The King:</strong> Must be surrounded on all 4 sides (or 3 sides and the throne).</li>
        <li><strong>Special:</strong> The throne and corners count as enemies for capture purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="morris">Nine Men's Morris</h2>
    <p class="era">Roman Empire • 500 BCE</p>
    
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Reduce your opponent to 2 pieces, or block them so they cannot move.</p>
    
    <h3>The Board</h3>
    <p>Three concentric squares with lines connecting their midpoints, creating 24 intersection points.</p>
    
    <h3>Phase 1: Placing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Players alternate placing one piece on any empty point.</li>
        <li>Each player has 9 pieces to place.</li>
        <li>Try to form "mills" (3 in a row) while preventing your opponent from doing so.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Phase 2: Moving</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After all pieces are placed, players alternate moving one piece to an adjacent empty point.</li>
        <li>Pieces can only move along the lines to connected points.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Mills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A "mill" is 3 pieces in a row along any line.</li>
        <li>Forming a mill allows you to remove one opponent's piece from the board.</li>
        <li>Pieces currently in a mill cannot be removed unless no other pieces are available.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Phase 3: Flying</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When reduced to only 3 pieces, a player may "fly" — move to ANY empty point, not just adjacent ones.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="mancala">Mancala</h2>
    <p class="era">Africa • 700 CE</p>
    
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Capture more seeds than your opponent. The game ends when one side is empty.</p>
    
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>The board has 12 small pits (6 per player) and 2 large stores. Each small pit starts with 4 seeds. Your store is the large pit on your right.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose a pit:</strong> Select one of YOUR pits (the 6 on your side).</li>
        <li><strong>Sow:</strong> Pick up all seeds from that pit and drop one in each pit counter-clockwise.</li>
        <li><strong>Include your store:</strong> Drop seeds in your store when you pass it.</li>
        <li><strong>Skip opponent's store:</strong> Never drop seeds in your opponent's store.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Special Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extra turn:</strong> If your last seed lands in your store, take another turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Capture:</strong> If your last seed lands in an empty pit on YOUR side, capture that seed plus all seeds in the pit directly opposite.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Game End</h3>
    <p>When one side is completely empty, the game ends. The other player captures all remaining seeds on their side. The player with the most seeds wins!</p>
