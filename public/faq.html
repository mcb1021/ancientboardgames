    <div class="faq-item">

    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>Are these the real historical rules?</h2>
        <p>We've based our rules on the best available archaeological and historical evidence. For games like the Royal Game of Ur, we use rules decoded from ancient tablets. Where historical rules are uncertain, we've made educated choices that prioritize fun gameplay.</p>

    <p class="category">Accounts & Progress</p>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>How does the ranking system work?</h2>
        <p>We use an ELO-based rating system. You start at 1200 points. Winning against higher-rated opponents earns more points, while losing to lower-rated opponents costs more. Each game has its own separate rating.</p>
